### Pin Board - a clone of the famous Pinterest

This app was created under the tutorial 12 web apps in 12 weeks by Mackenzie Child (@mackenziechild). This is the number 4 of the series but I'm not doing in exact order, I choose according with my curiosity and needs.

#### Project Planning
* It will have pins images
* Title and description
* Voting
* Users have to be signed to be able:
	* submit a new pin
	* vote
	* as well as edit and delete a pin
* Page is responsive

#### What have I learned:
Even though I discovered how to implement a picture uploader by using Carrierwave gem when I created my own blog, I wanted to see how Mackenzie Child would do his. I'm trying to learn best practices now.
